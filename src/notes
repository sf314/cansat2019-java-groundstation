So this works on windows:

javac -cp /mnt/c/Program\ Files/Java/jdk/lib/RXTXcomm.jar JGroundStation.java CSPort.java

java JGroundStation 
	if remote, complains about x11
	else, complains about NoClassDefFound
	Must specify path to .jar!
	First success used .jar in Java/jdk/lib

Use the x64 version of rxtx. May need to test which one to make it general.
